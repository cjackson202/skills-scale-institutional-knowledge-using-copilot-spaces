# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

## Overview

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation. This collection of process guides provides a comprehensive framework for how OctoAcme runs cross-functional projects to deliver product features, services, and integrations. Whether you're new to the team or looking for a refresher on our processes, this README serves as your central entry point and navigation guide.

OctoAcme's project management approach is built on five core principles: customer-first focus, iterative delivery, clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety. These principles guide every phase of our project lifecycle—from initial concept through delivery and continuous improvement. Our framework emphasizes transparency, collaboration, and learning, ensuring that teams can deliver high-quality outcomes while maintaining flexibility to adapt to changing needs.

Our project lifecycle follows a structured yet flexible path through five key phases: Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, and Retrospective. Each phase has clearly defined goals, deliverables, and decision gates to ensure alignment and reduce risk. Throughout this journey, cross-functional teams collaborate closely, with well-defined roles for Project Managers, Product Managers, Developers, QA/Testing, and Stakeholders. Regular communication cadences—including daily standups, weekly syncs, and monthly stakeholder updates—keep everyone informed and aligned.

Quality assurance and continuous improvement are woven throughout our processes. We maintain rigorous testing standards including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end smoke tests, complemented by automated CI/CD pipelines with security scanning. After each sprint, release, or milestone, we conduct retrospectives to capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements, fostering a culture of continuous growth and adaptation.
