# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management process documentation! This repository contains comprehensive guides, workflows, and best practices for managing projects at OctoAcme.

## Overview

OctoAcme follows a customer-first, iterative approach to project management. Our processes are designed to:

- **Prioritize customer value** and deliver measurable business outcomes
- **Enable iterative delivery** through small, testable increments
- **Ensure clear ownership** with defined roles and responsibilities
- **Support data-informed decisions** backed by metrics and evidence
- **Foster psychological safety** through open feedback and continuous learning

This documentation serves as the single source of truth for how we plan, execute, and deliver projects across all teams.
